# Security Reporting

Thank you in advance for helping us keep RudderStack secure!

Please report any security issues or vulnerabilities to [security@rudderstack.com](mailto:security@rudderstack.com), before proceeding to post them publicly as issues on GitHub or any other public channel like the RudderStack community Slack. These issues might also affect other users, and security vulnerabilities need to be handled quickly and sometimes privately.

We will triage the issue, contact you for further instructions and make sure to take any necessary measures as needed.

## Supported versions

We will fix any security bugs for the latest major.minor version published in the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rudderlabs/rudder-server).

| Version | Supported |
| :-------| :---------|
| Latest 1.x | ✅ |
| Older 1.x | ❌ |
| < 1.0 | ❌ |

We may fix the vulnerabilities in the older versions depending on the severity of the issue and the age of the release, but we are only committing to the latest version released.
