# HubSpot

Syncing prospects and leads into HubSpot means either integrating it with your existing source of truth, or uploading csvs manually. Once you begin deploying HubSpot forms for your gated content, new leads coming into your system will be automatically captured in HubSpot. HubSpot’s schema centers on contacts, but with different lifecycle stages. If your source of truth is Salesforce, you’d map in leads , which become contacts in HubSpot in phase 0 or 1 of the lifecycle. HubSpots lifecycle includes subscriber, lead, MQL, SQL, Opp, and Customer Evangelist.
