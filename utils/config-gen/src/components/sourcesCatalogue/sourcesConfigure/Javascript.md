## JavaScript

RudderStack’s JavaScript SDK utilizes our rudderanalytics.js library to send event data from your website to RudderStack as well as many other destinations of your choice, without implementing a new API every time. As rudderanalytics.js loads asynchronously on your web pages, you don’t have to worry about the page loading speed getting affected.

The JavaScript SDK also supports a feature called Autotrack. When enabled, it automatically tracks and captures important user activities such as clicks, form value changes and submit actions.

To know more about the SDK or to quickly get up and running with it, follow our Quick Start Guide.
