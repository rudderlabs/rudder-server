## HTTP API

With RudderStackâ€™s HTTP endpoints, you can track your customer event data. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers, which then route the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

Please check the [HTTP API Specification](https://docs.rudderstack.com/getting-started/http-api-specification)
