 ## Python

RudderStack’s Python SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your Python code. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers, which then route the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

To get started with installing and using the RudderStack’s Go SDK, check out the GitHub repository. For more information related to the Ruby client and the various supported API, please check out the Segment documentation.
