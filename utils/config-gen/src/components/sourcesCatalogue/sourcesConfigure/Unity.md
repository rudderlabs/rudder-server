## Unity

RudderStackâ€™s Unity SDK allows you to track and collect your customer event data in games. The Unity SDK is basically a wrapper that works on top of our Android or iOS SDK. Once integrated, you will be able to send the game-related event data to your preferred destination platforms for analytics or processing.

Make sure you check our documentation and the GitHub codebase to get an in-depth understanding of the Unity SDK.
