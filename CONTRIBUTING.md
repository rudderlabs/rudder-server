## RudderStack Contributor Agreement

To contribute to this project, we need you to sign the [**Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)**][CLA] for the first commit you make. By agreeing to the [**CLA**][CLA]
we can add you to list of approved contributors and review the changes proposed by you.

## How You Can Contribute to RudderStack

One way to contribute to our open source software is to create an integration. An integration is a connection between RudderStack and a downstream destination where you would like to send your event data. 

There are several reasons why you may want to build an integration:

- If you would like to send data to a certain destination, but RudderStack doesn't offer it yet.
- If you have developed a tool that you would like RudderStack to integrate with to expand your user base.
- If you want to add features to an already existing integration, and many more!

Feel free to chat with us on our [**Slack**](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack) channel and share your ideas!

> **_NOTE:_**  For creating an integration, the primary GitHub repository you will need to work with will be [`rudder-transformer`](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer).

You can also contribute to any open-source RudderStack project. View our [**GitHub page**](https://github.com/rudderlabs) to see all the different projects. If you encounter a bug or have an improvement, you can [**submit an issue**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/issues/new) describing your proposed change.

## Submitting a Pull Request ##

- For creating a pull request for an integration contribution, follow these instructions from our [**docs**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/user-guides/how-to-guides/how-to-submit-an-integration-pull-request)

- For any other pull requests, you can refer to this specific section of the same [**doc**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/user-guides/how-to-guides/how-to-submit-an-integration-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request). 

> **_NOTE:_**  The type of change you make will dictate what repositories you will need to make pull requests for. Please reach out to us on our [**Slack**](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack) channel if you have any questions.

## Committing

We prefer squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are committed to master as a single commit. All pull requests are squashed when merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit message.

## Installing and Setting Up RudderStack

To contribute to this project, you need to install RudderStack on your machine. You can do so by following our [**docs**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack) and set up RudderStack in no time.

## Getting Help

For any questions, concerns, or queries, you can start by asking a question on our [**Slack**](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack) channel.

### We look forward to your feedback on improving this project.
